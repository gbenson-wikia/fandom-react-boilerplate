# [Forerunner of the Empire](https://scryfall.com/card/rix/102/forerunner-of-the-empire)... meet [Polyraptor](https://scryfall.com/card/rix/144/polyraptor)!
On the surface, this may seem like a straightforward card interaction.  But in reality, it leads to a surprisingly complex set of steps.  Even the simplest scenario (a single Forerunner on the board, then cast Polyraptor) has an unexpected result: 7 Polyraptors on the board instead of the 8 one might anticipate.

I started to map out the interaction in a spreadsheet, but once I completed the "2 Forerunners on the board; cast Polyraptor" state machine, I realized that this would be easier (and more fun!) as a little web application that walks you through the interactions step-by-step.

For the purposes of this demonstration, we'll assume the player always takes the "...you may have Forerunner of the Empire deal 1 damage to each creature" optional trigger.
